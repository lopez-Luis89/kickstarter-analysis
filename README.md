# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	
The idea was to find insights about how well Louise Campaign did against other campaigns. 

## Analysis and Challenges

One of the main challenges was to come up with the same exact graphs and tables since we had to prep the data to be useful in the manners we wanted them since the questions were very specific oriented. Using VLOOKUP was challenging to use I did not know the in’s and out’s of it, also the COUNTIFS codes since it was tedious to add specific ranges and information contained in other sheets.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


 This graph was interesting too since different outcomes through out intervals of time, I would say that the most success was from spring on to summer, it is important although most of the success happened in those two seasons, the negative trend started at the end of spring and on.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The insights this graph offerred were pretty valuable since it require of lots of data calculation and organization to reach the solutions.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

 I guess the only challenge I encountered was in using the COUNTIF formula just because in intake several inputs and range in order to work successfully.

## Results


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. Seasonality is an important factor for new projects and their success

2. Staff preferences is another determining factor for the success and  minimization of failed goals.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
 
It is I important to note that the larger amount for the goal the higher the chance it will fail, you can clearly see on the graph that there’s almost a direct correlation with the success percentage vs the failure percentage VS the range of the goal.
